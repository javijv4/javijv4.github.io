[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://javijv4.github.io/files/CV_JJV.pdf)

I'm a PhD candidate in the Cardiac Biomechanics Lab at the University of Michigan under the guidance of Prof. David Nordsletten. Before starting my PhD studies I did a MSc in Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Hurtado at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. My research interests include cardiac mechanics, computational modeling, patient-specific models, and multiscale models of biological tissues.
